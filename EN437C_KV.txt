Spontaneous Fulfillment of the Twofold Benefit: A Supplication and Aspiration Prayer to the Supreme Site of Palpung Devīkoṭa, Tsādra Rinchen Drak True palace of Cakrasaṃvara, the Universal Lord, Supreme site of Cāritra, with the four modes of liberation, And Devīkoṭa, inseparable from these- I pray to this support and all that it supports! Until I and all others reach the seat of awakening, Bless us that we may be rid of all hindrances to our Dharma practice, That our supportive longevity, merit, wealth, and wisdom grow, And that we gain mastery over mind and appearances! In particular, bless us that the turmoil of these times be pacified, Such as trouble from evil barbarians, illness, famine, and strife; That the rains be timely and crops and cattle abound; And that the world be nurtured with benefit and happiness! Bless us that all beings may cultivate faith, renunciation, and bodhicitta, And that, by relying on the profound practices of ripening and liberation, They actualize, in the stages of training and no-more-training, The wisdom body of unity in this very life! I pray, please bring us good fortune that all the holders of the teachings live long, The fourfold patrons of the teachings prosper, The teachings of study and practice spread everywhere always, And virtue and goodness flourish throughout the three planes! In response to ardent requests, Khyentse Wangpo Pema Ösal Do Ngak Lingpa, a subject who delights the Lake-Born Guru, wrote this supplication on the first day of the waxing part of the sixth lunar month in the female Iron Sheep year (June 18, 1871). May there be virtuous goodness!
